What the heck is dimensionality reduction?
##############

## I'm not really sure what the project on this will actually be but I know that I want to use the Smartphone Dataset on kaggle.



Dimensionality Reduction is the process of reducing the number of input variables (features) in your dataset while preserving as much of the original information as possible.




let's use smartphone data for now
```{r}
df <- read.csv("Smartphones_cleaned_dataset.csv")
```

let's look at a summary of the raw data

```{r}
summary(df)
```
